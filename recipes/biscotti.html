    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of vegatable oil</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>3 1/4 cups of all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two cookie
          sheets or line with parchment paper.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Beat together sugar, oil, eggs, and anise extract in a medium bowl
          until well-blended. Combine flour and baking powder in a separate
          bowl; stir into egg mixture to form a heavy dough.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Divide dough into two equal pieces. Form each piece into a log the
          length of a cookie sheet. Place one log on each of the prepared
          sheets; and press dough down to 1/2-inch thickness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
          Transfer logs to wire racks; let sit until cool enough to handle,
          about 15 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Slice each log crosswise into about eighteen 1/2-inch-thick slices.
          Place slices cut-sides up back on the cookie sheets.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake until lightly toasted and golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes per side.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
