          Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
          garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggplant; cook, stirring
          constantly, until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes
          and juice; cook until sauce is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes.
